# Letterboxd Billboard Sync  
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXyTf7jTT3E 
#### Description:

**Letterboxd Billboard Sync** is a Python automation tool that syncs the current movie lineup from a local cinema (Showcase Argentina) directly into a curated Letterboxd list. This eliminates the need for manually checking the cinema website and updating the movie list, which was my original workflow. The goal was to automate a repetitive, tedious task with clean and functional code, using real-world libraries and tools like Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.

## Core Features

- **Web Scraping:**  
  The script scrapes movie data (title, genre, rating, and ticket purchase link) from the Showcase cinema billboard at `entradas.todoshowcase.com` using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

- **CSV Management:**  
  Each movie fetched is saved into a local CSV file (`movies.csv`) that serves as an intermediate data structure.

- **Selenium Automation:**  
  Using `selenium` and `webdriver-manager`, the script logs into my Letterboxd account, clears the target list, adds each scraped movie title, and updates the list description with the current timestamp.

- **Headless Mode (Optional):**  
  A configuration toggle allows running the script in headless mode, suitable for server environments or background automation.

- **Logging:**  
  Configurable logging gives detailed debug output or quiet mode depending on the setting.

## Project Files

- `project.py`:  
  The main driver script. Contains:
  - `main()`: Entry point  
  - `parse_movies_from_html()`: Extracts movie data from HTML  
  - `update_csv_from_web()`: Handles scraping and CSV update  
  - `update_letterboxd_list()`: Automates the Selenium sync  
  - `clear_list()`: Removes existing movies from the list  
  - `update_list_description()`: Adds last updated timestamp  

- `test_project.py`:  
  Contains three unit tests (using `pytest`) for the parsing logic. It validates HTML handling with and without expected fields like rating and links.

- `movies.csv`:  
  Auto-generated by the scraper. Can be deleted and will be regenerated.

- `requirements.txt`:  
  Lists all required Python packages:  
  `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, `pandas`, and `pytest`.

## Design Notes

- **Credential Management:**  
  For simplicity and full automation, Letterboxd login credentials are hardcoded. This is intentional for a personal script.

- **No Interactive Prompts:**  
  This project is fully automatic — no terminal input is required at runtime.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The script uses Selenium waits and fallbacks to handle slow page loads or missing HTML elements.

- **Limitations:**  
  The script uses only the English movie title for search on Letterboxd with no year, since the cinema website does not provide it. This may lead to incorrect matches for remakes or duplicates. The cinema site doesn't provide additional metadata like release year, so the system is limited to what it can scrape.

## Final Thoughts

This project is built entirely with Python and applies most of the core concepts from CS50p, including file I/O, unit testing, regular expressions (where needed), exceptions, conditionals, loops, OOP (via Selenium’s API), and external libraries. It is a practical and realistic example of solving a real-world annoyance with programming.
